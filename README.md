# Paraphrase generation and scoring repository
This is a very hairy project that has spanned 10+ individual code contributors, at least 6 repos, and has been actively under devopment since before 2016.  My goal with this repository is to finally create a single base of operation for everything.  To start, here's the current TODO list:

- [ ] Finish writing this README
- [ ] Test repo instructions
- [ ] Add environment

## Example usages:
- Generate paraphrases using patterns:
`alignSub/alignSub.py`
- To score paraphrases:
`scorer/score.py`
- Placeholder for lots more
